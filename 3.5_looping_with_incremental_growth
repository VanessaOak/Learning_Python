#A local biologist needs a program to predict population growth. The inputs would be:
#The initial number of organisms, as an int
#The rate of growth (a real number greater than 1), as a float
#The number of hours it takes to achieve this rate, as an int
#A number of hours during which the population grows, as an int
#For example, one might start with a population of 500 organisms, a growth rate of 2, and a growth period to achieve this rate of 6 hours. Assuming that none of the organisms die, this would imply that this population would double in size every 6 hours. Thus, after allowing 6 hours for growth, we would have 1000 organisms, and after 12 hours, we would have 2000 organisms.
#Write a program that takes these inputs and displays a prediction of the total population.
#An example of the program input and output is shown below:
#Enter the initial number of organisms: 10
#Enter the rate of growth [a real number > 1]: 2
#Enter the number of hours to achieve the rate of growth: 2
#Enter the total hours of growth: 6
#The total population is 80

org_start=int(input("Enter the initial number of organisms: "))
growth_rate =float(input("Enter the rate of growth: "))
hours_in_cycle=int(input("Enter the number of hours to achieve the rate of growth: "))
total_hrs=int(input("Enter the total hours of growth: "))
cycles=total_hrs/hours_in_cycle
for i in range(int(cycles)):
    org_start =org_start * growth_rate

print("The total population is", org_start)
